## Code with GirlScript Bangalore

This is our new initiative for the tech community to enhance their knowledge in the field of technology. For the same reason we are starting a **weekly challenge** on **GitHub** where each week some problems will be posted divided into three categories ie., **Easy, Medium and Hard** and for all the people who have just started the coding and for them too who are highly skilled in these topics. We are providing you the platform to brush up your knowledge. People can contribute **solutions to the problems** or they can **review the code** depending upon their interests. 

Initially all the questions will be based on **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Each week the questions will be posted on Saturday in the ```README.md``` file inside the folder with the name ```{{ date }}``` and the solutions will be posted on the next Friday.

You are free to use any programming language and the best solution from each programming language along with the name of contributors will be posted inside the same ```README.md``` file.

> We will be declaring the best ```coder of the month``` based on your submissions.
