## Code with GirlScript Bangalore

Welcome to **GirlScript Bangalore's** brand new initiative! If you are a techie üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª, if you want to get started with **open source contribution** üíª, if you are looking to improve your skills üìà, you have landed in just the right place! ‚¨á

Code with GirlScript Bangalore is how we want to give back to the tech community all over the world! We want to help everyone - beginners and advanced find their calling and enhance their technical knowledge.

As a part of this initiative, we would post weekly challenges categorised as easy, medium and hard.
‚≠êYes, we do have something for everyone!‚≠ê

You could choose to participate as either:
> - Contribute solutions to the challenges ü§ì
> - Review solutions posted by other participants üßê

Come along, brush up your techie skills!

To begin with, we would be focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms. 

Each week, we would publish a new challenge on Saturday. The question would be available in: <Date folder> - README.md 
The answer would be published the following week on Friday! üçª

> Participants are free to use any programming language of their choice. The best solution each week would earn their contributors their name as 'SUPER CONTRIBUTOR'  in the same README.md file.
> Based on the number of solutions, consistency, design, logic and implementation, we would pick the 'GEEK OF GEEKS' üëë each month.

## Follow the steps below to get started right away!

- Fork this repo: You'll see a Fork button on the top right against the name of this repository. This creates an identical copy of this repository and adds it to your repositories.

- Open the forked repository: Navigate to your profile find the repository <your_github_profile_name>/<this_repository>

- Clone the repository: (Follow this step only if you would like to add files from your local terminal) Clone the repository by copying the clone link (find it against the name of the repository on the right). 

- Add the file: If you have indeed cloned the repository to your local machine, you can add the file by dropping your solution to the correct folder. 
If you are using the GitHub webpage itself, find the add file button on the right after moving to the correct folder. Type the name of the file with the correct extension and add the contents of the file.

- Track the file: (Only for locally cloned repository) Type in the command git status by starting up a terminal in your repository directory. This will show all the untracked files.
Now use the command git add <file_name> to track the file. Type in git status again to ensure that it is now tracked correctly.

- Commit the file: For locally cloned repository, use the git commit -m <commit message> to commit your file. 
For GitHub web, simply add the commit message and description at the bottom of the page to add the new file.

- Create pull request: For locally cloned repository, use git push. 
For GitHub web, simply move over to the original repository and click on New Pull Request and compare forked repositories. Provide appropriate description and VOILA!

If you have successfully followed these steps, you're one step closer to being a 'SUPER CONTRIBUTOR' and 'GEEK OF GEEKS'.ü•≥ But don't stop, continue making contributions and improve your chances each week! Review solutions of peers and suggest improvements. Let's build a strong community of kind developers! üë≠üë´üë¨
